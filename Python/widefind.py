#
#This application handles all communication with the MQTT broker for the widefind system hosted on the 'LTU-H2Al' network.
#This application will be started and used by the 'sensor_server.py' application which must be run with 'fibaro.py' and 'widefind.py' in the same
#directory and the interchange of data between the components must follow current structures.
#Both of these separate python files accually contain the functionallty for communicating with both fibaro and widefind systems
#
#This application was written as a part of the 'Unreal visualization of a smart home' project active during the course D0020E from 11-2020 to
#03-2021.

#The class takes arguments for TimeToLive in seconds, the client socket/address for transmission and a asynchronous
#variable for printing to preserve the console output of the application as a whole.
