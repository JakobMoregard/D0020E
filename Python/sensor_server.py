#
#This application sets up a threaded UDP server for communication between a client and the Fibaro REST api as well as the mqtt broker that publishes
#updates on the 'ltu-system/messages/' topic. This server can only hosted on a machine within the 'LTU-H2Al' network as both the mqtt broker as
#well as the REST api will be unreachable form any othe network. This application must be run with 'fibaro.py' and 'widefind.py' in the same
#directory and the interchange of data between the components must follow current structures.
#Both of these separate python files accually contain the functionallty for communicating with both fibaro and widefind systems
#
#This application was written as a part of the 'Unreal visualization of a smart home' project active during the course D0020E from 11-2020 to
#03-2021.
